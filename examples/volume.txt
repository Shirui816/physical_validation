Now determining correlation time
Calculating [
 8.062 
 6.061 
] as the statistical inefficiencies of the volume
Using [
 8.062 
 6.061 
] as the statistical inefficiencies
data has been subsampled using the statistical inefficiencies
data has been subsampled using the statistical inefficiencies
setting random number seed for bootstrapping 12345
True slope of ln(P_2(V)/P_1(V)) should be -7.18333680
Now computing log of partition functions using BAR
