Introduction
============

Advances in recent years have made molecular dynamics (MD) simulations a
powerful tool in molecular-level research, allowing the prediction of
experimental observables in the study of systems such as proteins, drug
targets or membranes. The quality of any prediction based on MD results
targets or membranes. The quality of any prediction based on MD results
will, however, strongly depend on the validity of underlying physical
assumptions.

This package is intended to help detecting (sometimes hard-to-spot)
unphysical behavior of simulations, which may have statistically important
influence on their results. It is part of a two-fold approach to
increase the robustness of molecular simulations.

First, it empowers users of MD programs to test the physical validity on
their respective systems and setups. The tests range from simple
post-processing analysis to more involved tests requiring additional
simulations. These tests can significantly increase the
reliability of MD simulations by catching a number of common simulation
errors violating physical assumptions, such as non-conservative
integrators, deviations from the specified Boltzmann ensemble, or lack of ergodicity
between degrees of freedom. To make usage as easy as possible,
parsers for several popular MD program output formats are provided.

Second, it can be integrated in MD code testing environments. While
unphysical behavior can be due to poor or incompatible choices of
parameters by the user, it can also originate in coding errors
within the program. Physical validation tests can be integrated in the
code-checking mechanism of MD software packages to facilitate the
detection of such bugs. The `physical-validation` package is currently
used in the automated code-testing facility of the GROMACS software
package, ensuring that every major releases passes a number of physical
sanity checks performed on selected representative systems before
shipping.

.. note:: We are always looking to enlarge our set of tests. If you are a
   MD user or developer and have suggestions for physical validity tests
   missing in this package, we would love to hear from you! Please
   consider getting in touch with us via our `github page`_.


Installation
============

The latest version is available at the `github page`_. Once you downloaded
or cloned the repository, simply type
::

   python3 setup.py install

while being in the root directory of the downloaded package.


`examples/` folder
==================

The folder `examples/` contains examples (simulation results and analysis
scripts) which are used in the following to introduce the functionality of
the package. More specifically, the subfolders of `examples/` contain

* Folder `water_ensemble/`: GROMACS result files of water systems simulated with
  different thermostating and barostating algorithms. Specifically, the
  subfolder `be/` contains NVT results obtained using a Berendsen thermostat,
  the subfolder `vr/` contains NVT results obtained using the GROMACS v-rescale
  thermostat, while the subfolders `be_pr/` and `vr_pr/` contain the corresponding
  NPT results obtained by adding a Parinello-Rahman barostat to the systems. Each
  system was simulated at two different state points (different temperatures, and
  possibly pressures), stored in subfolders `base/` and `ensemble_1/` under the
  respective system folders. Each of these folders then contain the following
  files:

  - `start.gro`: the starting configuration, containing 900 three-site water molecules
  - `system.top`: the topology of the system of water molecules
  - `system.mdp`: the GROMACS input file
  - `mdout.mdp`: the GROMACS input file obtained from `gmx grompp`
  - `system.gro`: the end configuration
  - `system.edr`: the resulting (binary) energy file

* Folder `argon_integrator/`: GROMACS result files of argon systems simulated with
  different van-der-Waals cutoff schemes. `none/` contains the results of
  simulations performed with vdW interactions cut off at 1 nm without any
  correction of the discontinuity at the cut-off distance. `shift/` contains
  the results of simulations performed with vdW interactions cut off at 1 nm
  and a potential shifted by a constant value such that it reaches zero at
  the cut-off distance. `switch/` contains the results of simulations performed
  with vdW interactions cut off at 1 nm where not only the potential, but also
  the forces were altered in a way to have both the forces and the potential
  smoothly reaching zero at the cut-off distance. For each choice of interaction
  function, the same simulation was repeated five times, with each new simulation
  halving the integration time step compared to the previous one.


Simulation data
===============

The data of simulations to be validated are best represented by objects
of the  :class:`.SimulationData` type. While lower-level functions accepting
bare arrays and numbers are available, the  :class:`.SimulationData` objects
combine ease-of-use and higher stability in form of input testing.

The  :class:`.SimulationData` objects are consisting of information about the
simulation and the system. This information is collected in objects of different
classes, namely

* :obj:`.SimulationData.units` of type :class:`.UnitData`:
  Information on the units used by the simulation program.
* :obj:`.SimulationData.ensemble` of type :class:`.EnsembleData`:
  Information on the sampled ensemble.
* :obj:`.SimulationData.system` of type :class:`.SystemData`:
  Information on the system (atoms, molecules, constraints, etc.).
* :obj:`.SimulationData.observables` of type :class:`.ObservableData`:
  Trajectories of observables along the simulation.
* :obj:`.SimulationData.trajectory` of type :class:`.TrajectoryData`:
  Position / velocity / force trajectories along the simulation.
* :obj:`.SimulationData.dt` of type `float`:
  The time step at which the simulation was performed.

The :class:`.SimulationData` objects can either be constructed
directly from arrays and numbers, or (partially) automatically via parsers.

To facilitate the use of the physical validation suite, simulation results
generated by selected software packages can be automatically created by
:class:`.Parser` objects. The currently supported MD packages are:

* GROMACS: :class:`.GromacsParser`

Package-specific parsers are subclasses of :class:`.Parser`, and need to
redefine the :func:`.Parser.get_simulation_data` returning a
:class:`.SimulationData` object.

For generic input, the flat file parser :class:`.FlatfileParser` allows to
create a :class:`.SimulationData` object from files containing trajectories
of observables and the positions and velocities of the atoms in the system.
It requires, however, to fill information on the units, the ensemble and the
system by hand. Furthermore, it is of course possible to fill all attributes
of :class:`.SimulationData` by hand, e.g. when starting from data stored
in python arrays rather than in files.

Please see :ref:`doc_parsers` for more details on the :class:`.SimulationData`
type and the available parsers.

.. note:: We are looking to enlarge the collection of parsers to make the
   use of the package as convenient as possible for as many users as
   possible. If your MD program of choice is not supported (yet), please
   consider either writing your own parser and contribute it by creating
   a pull request on the project's `github page`_, or contacting us to
   let us know about your needs, and we can coordinate about introducing
   the appropriate parser.

.. _example_sec_1:

Examples
--------
To illustrate the creation of SimulationData, we will look at the first part
of the analysis script `ana_water.py` located in the `examples/water_ensemble/`
folder. First, after some necessary import and definitions, the GROMACS
parser is created:
::

   import physical_validation as pv
   import os

   systems = ['vr', 'be', 'vr_pr', 'be_pr']

   # change this to fit to your GROMACS installation
   parser = pv.data.GromacsParser(exe='~/bin/gromacs/bin/gmx',
                                  includepath='~/bin/gromacs/share/gromacs/top')

Having the parser readily available, actually reading in the simulation data is a
one-line command that is easily included in a loop for the different systems
of interest:
::

   for sys in systems:
       print('### Analyzing system ' + sys)
       print('## Reading lower temperature result')
       dir_low = os.path.join(sys, 'base')
       res_low = parser.get_simulation_data(
           mdp=os.path.join(dir_low, 'mdout.mdp'),
           top=os.path.join(dir_low, 'system.top'),
           gro=os.path.join(dir_low, 'system.gro'),
           edr=os.path.join(dir_low, 'system.edr')
       )
       print('## Reading high temperature result')
       dir_high = os.path.join(sys, 'ensemble_1')
       res_high = parser.get_simulation_data(
           mdp=os.path.join(dir_high, 'mdout.mdp'),
           top=os.path.join(dir_high, 'system.top'),
           gro=os.path.join(dir_high, 'system.gro'),
           edr=os.path.join(dir_high, 'system.edr')
       )


Kinetic energy validation
=========================
Kinetic energy tests include testing the likelihood of a trajectory
originating from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and validating the
temperature equipartition between groups of degrees of freedom. For
details on the employed algorithms, please check the respective
function documentations.

Functions
---------
*Maxwell-Boltzmann ensemble validation:*
:func:`physical_validation.kinetic_energy.mb_ensemble`


*Equipartition validation:*
:func:`physical_validation.kinetic_energy.equipartition`

Examples
--------
With the data structures created in :ref:`example_sec_1` (`res_low` and
`res_high`), the kinetic energy ensemble of each simulated state point
can be validated as follows:
::

   print('\n## Validating kinetic energy distribution (alpha = 0.05)')
   alpha = 0.05
   print('# Low T:')
   pv.kinetic_energy.mb_ensemble(res_low, alpha=alpha, verbose=True,
                                 screen=False, filename=sysplot + '_low_mb')
   print('# High T:')
   pv.kinetic_energy.mb_ensemble(res_high, alpha=alpha, verbose=True,
                                 screen=False, filename=sysplot + '_high_mb')

This will plot the sampled distribution along with its analytical counterpart,
and print out the result of the analysis. For example for the NVT simulation
using the v-rescale algorithm (folder `vr/base`), the result will indicate
that under the chosen confidence (:math:`\alpha=0.05`), the null-hypothesis
that the energy is Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed stands:
::

   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test result: p = 0.897073
   Null hypothesis: Kinetic energy is Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed
   Confidence alpha = 0.050000
   Result: Hypothesis stands

On the other hand, the NVT simulation using the Berendsen algorithm will show
a dramatically different picture:
::

   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test result: p = 3.10225e-18
   Null hypothesis: Kinetic energy is Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed
   Confidence alpha = 0.050000
   Result: Hypothesis rejected

.. todo:: Equipartition example

Ensemble validation
===================
As the distribution of configurational quantities like the potential
energy :math:`U`, the volume :math:`V` or (for the grand and semigrand canonical ensembles) 
the number of each species are in general not known analytically, testing the likelihood
of a trajectory sampling a given ensemble is less straightforward than
for the kinetic energy. However, generally, the ratio of the probability
distribution between samplings of the same ensemble at different state
points (e.g. at different temperatures, different pressures) is known
[Shirts2013]_.
Providing two simulations at different state points therefore allows a
validation of the sampled ensemble.

Note that the ensemble validation function is automatically inferring the
correct test based on the simulation that are given as input.

Functions
---------
:func:`physical_validation.ensemble.check`

Examples
--------
Still using the data structures created in :ref:`example_sec_1` (`res_low` and
`res_high`), the generated ensemble of the potential energy can now be validated,
to check whether a similar trend as for the kinetic energy can be observed. The
relevant line of code reads
::

   print('\n## Validating ensemble')
   quantiles = pv.ensemble.check(res_low, res_high, quiet=False,
                                 screen=False, filename=sysplot + '_ensemble')

The ensemble validation function used the two simulation results at lower and
higher state point to calculate the ratio of the energy distributions and
compare this ratio to the analytical expectation. As we have validated the
kinetic energy separately before, it makes sense to only use the potential
energy for this second validation (`total_energy=False`). The relevant result
from these calculations is the deviation from the analytical expectation,
reported in terms of the number of standard deviations (quantiles) the result
is off. The bootstrapped maximum-likelihood analysis of the NVT simulations
performed with the v-rescale thermostat reads
::

   ---------------------------------------------
        Maximum Likelihood Analysis (analytical error)
   ---------------------------------------------
        df = 467.57724 +/- 9.81112
   ---------------------------------------------
        Estimated slope       vs.   True slope
   ---------------------------------------------
      0.013141 +/-    0.000276  |     0.013091
   ---------------------------------------------

   (That's 0.18 quantiles from true slope=0.013091, FYI.)

   ---------------------------------------------
    True dT =  10.000, Eff. dT =  10.039+/-0.211
   ---------------------------------------------

This corresponds to a near-perfect agreement with the analytical expectation,
suggesting that the ensemble sampled by the potential energy is very close to
a canonical NVT ensemble.

Performing the same analysis with the NVT simulations using the Berendsen
thermostat leads to a significantly different result:
::

   ---------------------------------------------
        Maximum Likelihood Analysis (analytical error)
   ---------------------------------------------
        df = 808.17863 +/- 19.48125
   ---------------------------------------------
        Estimated slope       vs.   True slope
   ---------------------------------------------
      0.022714 +/-    0.000548  |     0.013091
   ---------------------------------------------

   (That's 17.57 quantiles from true slope=0.013091, FYI.)
    (Ouch!)
   ---------------------------------------------
    True dT =  10.000, Eff. dT =  17.351+/-0.418
   ---------------------------------------------

This result indicates that using Berendsen thermostat does not only not
generate the proper distribution of the kinetic energy, but does also
effect on the expected ratio of potential energy distribution at different
temperatures.

There are three possible tests for NPT ensemble, each requiring
different simulations. If the two simulations were performed at
different temperatures, then the distribution of the instantaneous
enthalpy :math:`U + PV` is tested.  If the two simulations were
performed at different pressures, then the distribution of :math:`V`
is tested. If simulations were performed at both different
temperatures and pressures, then test of the joint distribution of
:math:`U` and :math:`V` is performed.

Support for grand and semigrand canonical ensembles, validating the
distribution of $N$ and $U$ or composition will be provided soon; in
the meantime, this functionality can still be found in the
checkensemble_ repository.


Integrator Validation
=====================
A symplectic integrator can be shown to conserve a constant of motion
(such as the energy in a microcanonical simulation) up to a fluctuation
that is quadratic in time step chosen. Comparing two or more
constant-of-motion trajectories realized using different time steps (but
otherwise unchanged simulation parameters) allows a check of the
symplecticity of the integration. Note that lack of symplecticity does not
necessarily imply an error in the integration algorithm, it can also hint
at physical violations in other parts of the model, such as non-continuous
potential functions, imprecise handling of constraints, etc.

Functions
---------
:func:`physical_validation.integrator.convergence`

Examples
--------
To demonstrate the integration validation, we will use the results in
folder `argon_integrator`, and the corresponding analysis script
`ana_argon.py` located in that folder. As described above, this folder
contains the result of an argon system simulated with different cut-off
schemes of the van-der-Waals interactions, two of which include a
discontinuity of the forces (in subfolder `shift/`) or even
both the forces and the potential (in subfolder `none/`). These small
discontinuities are not unlike bugs that could be present in an interaction
calculation, and will therefore be used to demonstrate the use of the
integrator convergence validation to detect errors in MD codes.

The first lines of the script `ana_argon.py` are very similar to the
previously discussed script `ana_water.py`, setting up the necessary
prerequisites and reading the results using the parser. The actual test
is then called as
::

   pv.integrator.convergence(res, verbose=True,
                             filename=sysplot)

where `res` is a list of :class:`.SimulationData` objects of identical
simulations performed at different integrator time steps.

The final output of the script `ana_argon.py` reads
::

The outputs of the function are the time step, the average value of the
constant of motion, and its RMSD during the simulation. The fourth
column gives the measured slope of the constant of motion - a large
value here would indicate a strong drift and hence a problem in the
integrator. Even without strong drift, as in the current situation, a
large deviation in the ratio between the rmsd values compared to the
ratio between the time step will indicates some error in the integrator.
The reason for a failure of this test might not always be intuitively clear,
as many components play into the integrator convergence - the integrator
algorithm itself, but also the interaction function (e.g. non-continuous
cut-off) or the numerical precision of the floating point operations.

In the examples presented here, the integrator convergence validation
shows a high sensibility towards the incontinuities describes above. In
the case with discontinuous potential and forces, the constant of motion
shows practically no dependence on the time step. But also with the
shifted (and hence continuous) potential, the large fluctuations around
the expected convergence indicate a problem in the calculation. Ensuring
continuity in the forces allows, on the other hand, to massively reduce
these fluctuations.
